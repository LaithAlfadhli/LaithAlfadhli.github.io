                                    I was responsible for creating 90% of the back end integration of the site.
                                    These functions typically involved grabbing and determinating items from the firebase database established, 
                                    uploading an entry to the database or editing an entry on the database.

                                    I was also responsible for manually testing each of these created functions and bug handling if something went wrong in the integration of the front end and back end.

                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <p> 
                        I was typically very hasty when creating my functions, as I would strive to have a working implementation that I understood. 
                        I was working with limited knowledge of firebase as the course instructed us on the use of MongoDB.
                         I eventually learned how to optimise my code to suit the firebase style better, but my initial attempts did appear sloppy. 
                         The most important takeaways from this project were being adaptable, asking questions when unfamiliar with a new piece of software, and thinking more critically 
                         over my code before pushing it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another important lesson was to know how all the systems would interact with one another to identify areas that could be generating bugs quickly. 
                        We made sure to do this through the readme that would be updated and explain how each file, function, and part of the project worked and the expected outcome.
                    </p>
