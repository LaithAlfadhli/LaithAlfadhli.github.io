                        WorldStats is a quiz game that aims to teach its players about statistics and different parts of the world if they are inclined to explore. 
                        The game was a university group project with four members as a group and a client that would demand elements to include in the game. 
                        The allocated timeframe to complete the project was thirteen weeks.

                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <p> 
                        The main takeaways for this project were developing skills working with a client to produce a product that meets the allocated requirements. 
                        Client vision often did not align with our meetings' vision, so it was essential for us to develop prototypes and use examples of existing games to show a quick gameplay 
                        demo to ensure effective communication. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some lessons I learned when it came to game development include designing levels that utilise space efficiently and using problem-solving to take a generic system and 
                        modify it to fit the game's needs. As I was designing levels 2 and 3 of the game, I noticed that I had a lot of dead space where the character is walking with no interaction 
                        with the world causing boredom in the player. When designing a game, I plan to add content that the player can interact with in the future as they move between different endpoints. 
                        An example of the latter is the quiz system based on a tutorial on youtube that I customised t allow for the option of input field questions. 
                        I would use the same system as the foundation of the dialogue system. 
                        I noticed that I could use the same technique to generate a series of conversational responses after clicking a button on the screen, similar to how you could generate a new question after submitting an answer. 
                        The ability to adapt these solutions will help me to develop games in the future efficiently. 
                    </p>
