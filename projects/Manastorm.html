                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the primary ones for game development is properly defining core mechanics and developing
                        the mechanics that prioritise those that suit the intended player experience. We failed to
                        express our core mechanics adequately due to the bloated list of features we wanted to implement
                        into our scope within the allotted time. In hindsight, in the initial three sprints, we should
                        have focused on; movements controlled by the keyboard, shooting, player health, player death,
                        rounds, assigning teams and networking. Rather than focusing on movement controlled by key
                        presses, destructible walls, climbing, vaulting, and networking. If we had done this, we would
                        have prioritised the mechanics that would serve the intended player experience of a competitive
                        team shooter and let us have a much stronger foundation to add things like destructible walls,
                        the planting game mode and ghosts.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, designing the most technically tricky game components should not have taken
                        precedence over the less complicated but vital features that create the intended player
                        experience. For example, mechanics such as; players being able to shoot each other, lose health,
                        and die, were more critical to implement than climbing and destructible walls, as these features
                        are the fundamental aspects for a player versus player experience. Therefore, prioritising the
                        essential mechanics and correctly identifying them is a skill that I can utilise in future
                        projects to ensure that the game has a strong foundation and can deliver the desired player
                        experience.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another lesson learned throughout the project is the importance and difficulty of organising
                        playtesting. The value of playtesting was never in question; however, we did underestimate the
                        difficulty of obtaining playtesters. The main issue was that we required four players to play
                        simultaneously, and we had to view their perspectives as they played. Initially, we reached out
                        to those within our friend groups interested in playing FPS games to playtest, but we had few
                        who could play within the timeframe before the end of a sprint and even fewer who could play
                        simultaneously. The lesson here being we should have invited as many people in our friend groups
                        as possible, and we should have asked earlier on in the sprint to set a date with them that
                        works.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another lesson is that we should have had playable builds to playtest before the weekend of the
                        second week in a sprint, as we found that our playtesters were generally only able to play on a
                        Saturday. We failed to do this for sprint four due to crunch, which meant we did not realise
                        that we forgot to make shooting enjoyable to players until it was almost too late. In future
                        endeavours, it would be best to playtest at least once every sprint and to reach out to all our
                        contacts to ensure that we can have more people to test the game potentially.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In terms of communication, a lesson learned was to be firm about holding team-wide meetings and
                        setting deadlines before the sprint end. We grew lax in our duty to hold team-wide meetings,
                        instead preferring meetings where only half the group was present or simply communicating over
                        Discord in the later stages of the project. We relied on text updates to explain the work we
                        were completing and rarely showed or discussed how we were implementing features instead of the
                        projectâ€™s start. While we still had meetings at the end of sprints, they were typically about
                        the workload for the next sprint and what features should be implemented into the game. The
                        problem is that it felt like we were a collection of individuals working on different parts
                        without a clue how they connected, rather than a team working together to create an enjoyable
                        experience with a shared and clearly defined vision. There was also no discussion about ensuring
                        a playable build was deployed and tested before the end of the sprint. Some features were only
                        completed on the last day of the sprint as there were no in-group deadlines set, which caused
                        delays to the playtests. In the future, in-group deadlines will be pivotal to ensuring that we
                        have a playable build that is playtested before the end of a sprint. Another consideration is to
                        hold more meaningful and common meetings, particularly in the second week of a sprint, to ensure
                        the group are all on the same page and understand how the features they are implementing can
                        impact the game experience.
